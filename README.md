This Django-based project is a dynamic encyclopedia platform that allows users to view, create, search, edit, and explore encyclopedia entries stored in Markdown format. Key features include:

Entry Pages: Renders encyclopedia entries with Markdown-to-HTML conversion for a seamless viewing experience.
Search Functionality: Supports exact and substring matching for intuitive navigation to relevant entries.
CRUD Operations: Enables users to create, edit, and save entries with pre-filled editing forms and duplicate prevention.
Random Entry: Directs users to a randomly selected encyclopedia page for discovery.
User-Friendly Design: Implements responsive templates using Django views and templates for consistent navigation.
This project showcases my skills in Python, Django, Markdown processing, and dynamic web app development.
