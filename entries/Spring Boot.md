#Spring Boot

Spring Boot is an open-source framework used to simplify the development of Java-based applications. It is built on top of the Spring Framework and provides a set of tools and libraries to quickly set up, configure, and run Java applications with minimal setup.

Spring Boot aims to make it easier for developers to get started with Spring by offering out-of-the-box configurations and production-ready features such as embedded servers (e.g., Tomcat or Jetty). It removes much of the boilerplate configuration traditionally required in Spring applications, making it an ideal choice for microservices and web-based applications.

Key Features:
- **Auto Configuration:** Automatically configures the application based on the project's dependencies.
- **Embedded Servers:** Includes support for embedded servers like Tomcat, Jetty, and Undertow.
- **Production-Ready:** Includes features like metrics, health checks, and externalized configuration for deployment.

Spring Boot's ability to "just run" makes it an ideal choice for developers who want to focus on writing business logic rather than spending time configuring the application infrastructure.
